# Wasting Time: Analyzing the ATUS Dataset

## Description

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes yearly data about Americans' use of their time: [American Time Use Survey](http://www.bls.gov/tus/home.htm#data).

This data is used to find out information like how many hours the average person spends per day doing household activities, caring for household children and spending time on leisure activities. You can see [the 2014 survey results](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm) for more examples.

### Analysis
I have analyzed the respondents' television activities and the number of children in the household. I've broken these areas down into more specific sub-groups to get at data I considered to be interesting.
